A group project for Software Architecture and Design

This is based on the previous submission of the group proposal.
Features and concepts are subject to change.


The objective of this project is to design / develop an interface that assist users who have questions or issues with their vehicles . 

The features would include:
    - submitting pictures of their vehicle for an estimated examination
    - allow user to submit questions to professional technicians for recommendations on parts and services
    - assist the user with locating parts and services
    - allow the user to create a profile that details the car model, mileage, service history, and any additional information that can be applied
    - manage submitted questions and response based on the user outline
    - keep an up-to-date system to track all mechanic shops and websites that are available and if they can provide the recommended services.


A Car Parts and Service Searcher app is ideal because it allows us to create our own search engine. Involves creating a simplified UI and easy experience for users to find what they need to fix their car.

The goal is to bridge the gap between the customer and qualified professional mechanics.  This will allow users to narrow potential service issues, get price quotes, and shop around for potential mechanic shops.  

Our priority is to create a remarkable customer experience that puts more control into the userâ€™s hands and to relieve some of the stress that comes from having car problems.
